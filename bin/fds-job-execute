usage: fds-job-execute [-h] [-t] [-r regex] [files]

Executes ALL scripts in the current folder in alphabetical order.

Currently used extensions are: .py .r .R .sh .sql

[files] file names or file name patterns as used in 'ls' syntax.

If the '-r' option is provided then regular expressions are used to filter [files].
Extended regular expressions are used as in 'grep -E' or 'egrep'.

For instance you can do:

    fds-job-execute *.py              # all python scripts
    fds-job-execute *.R               # all R scripts
    fds-job-execute s010_*            # all scripts which name starts with s010_

    fds-job-execute -r mypattern      # contains mypattern
    fds-job-execute -r ^k0            # starts with k0
    fds-job-execute -r ^k0[12]        # starts with k01 or k02
    fds-job-execute -r '^k01|^k02'    # starts with k01 or k02 ; ' is needed if | is not escaped
    fds-job-execute -r ^k01\|^k02     # starts with k01 or k02 ; the \ is necessary here and the '
    fds-job-execute -r '^k(01|02)'    # starts with k01 or k02 ; ' is needed
    fds-job-execute -r R$             # ends with R
    fds-job-execute -r py$            # ends with py
    fds-job-execute -r '(R|py)$       # ends with R or py

    fds-job-execute -r '\.R$'         # has .R  extension. The ' is formally needed for the grep.
    fds-job-execute -r '\.py$'        # has .py extension
    fds-job-execute -r '(\.R|\.py)$'  # has .py extension

    fds-job-execute -r '^[^TAG]'      # does NOT start with TAG
    fds-job-execute -r '^[py$]'       # does NOT end   with py

-t: testing mode. Scripts to be executed will be displayed but not actually executed. 
    Use this option to test your regular expressions before running them.
-r: regular expressions to define the files which have to be executed.

files: files or file name pattern.
